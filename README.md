# Derby_Dining
## A Code KY Project

Hi everyone, this is a project for Code Kentucky/Louisville its a resturant website based around Horse Racing - specifically the Kentucky Derby.

Features

- My first feature is to calculate and display the data of how many days until an event. In the case of the website it tells how many days until the KY Derby. This feature is on the home page.

- My second feature is to display information from a third-party API. I used the free cocktail API to display drinks and their ingredients. This is found on the drinks page.

- My third feature is to validate user input and prevent invalid input. This feature can be tested on the Sign Up page on the website.

- My fourth feature is to implement modern interactive UI features. This can be seen on the Book a Table page. It features a dropdown box with day of the week selection and time, an input box for the reserver's name and phone number, and number of persons which the value can be typed or can be increased or decreased with arrows in the box.

To get the most out of the website, please download the code and open the files in Visual Studio Code and open the pages with the extension Live Server.
